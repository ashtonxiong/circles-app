CS193X Final Project Milestone
==============================

Project Title: Circles
Your Name: <Ashton Xiong>
Your SUNetID: <axiong12>

Overview
--------
I am currently still brainstorming Information. I apologize for a delayed submission. I am trying to better uderstand 
how I can implement functionality and create new users on this website

Project Changes
---------------
In my initial Project design I was going to implement "circles/groups" of friends taht you can write notes too but realizing this may be too complicated.
I am thinking about changnign this topic to create a more broader and easierer concept, so instead of creating as many groups as possible
limit to 3-4, say perhaps the year you graduate.

Implementation Details
----------------------
I am thinking about making a login page for the webpage. This will need to be done in the api and making sure a user exist and if the session is currently logged in.
Additionally I need to see how I can keep track of the frontend and see if a user is currently logged in

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Unsure of anny externl libraries, may implement other css libraries to make webpage more appealing

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Will look at github repos (will cite if i take insperation from them) and other sources as well as a project from my CS142 project.
Anything else?

Thank you Michael for being an amazing prof and lecturer for this class. I learned a lot about full-stack development and plan to use
these skills in personal projects and other web-development classes.
