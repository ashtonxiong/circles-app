circles and post in circles that your friends or yourself hhave created. >

Running

<
run just npm install, no other libraries/packages
>
Do we need to load data from init_db.mongodb? <YES>

Features
--------
<
1) Select A "Circle" that is similar to a reddit thread that will list all of the posts that are related to this "Circle"
2) Create a new Circle that you can start if it is anything interesting or personal, and make new users to see if these changes persist via MongoDB

Collaboration and libraries
---------------------------
<
This project took a lot of inspiration from assignment 3.1 and assignment 3.2. I recycled the files for apirequest, api/index.js, user.js, etc...
I hope that this does not deter from the overall originality and functionality of my project.>

Anything else?
-------------
Thank you Michael for being an amazing prof and lecturer for this class. I learned a lot about full-stack development and plan to use
these skills in personal projects and other web-development classes.>
